## Ansible Automation for AEM

wcm.io DevOps provides a set of [Ansible][ansible] roles to automate infrastructure setup and configuration management for Adobe Experience Manager (AEM).

The Ansible roles are optimized to be used together with [CONGA][conga], but some can also be used standalone.

For an in-depth overview see this talk:

* [Automate AEM Deployment with Ansible and wcm.io CONGA][aem-ansible-adaptto-2017] - adaptTo() 2017
* [Demo project][aem-ansible-adaptto-2017-demo]

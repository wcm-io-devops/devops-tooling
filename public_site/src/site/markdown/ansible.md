## Ansible Automation for AEM

wcm.io DevOps provides a set of [Ansible][ansible] roles to automate infrastructure setup and configuration management for Adobe Experience Manager (AEM).

The Ansible roles are optimized to be used together with [CONGA][conga], but some can also be used standalone.

A good starting point for setting up AEM projects for deployment automation with CONGA and Ansible is using the [wcm.io Maven Archetype for AEM Configuration Management][aem-configmgmt-archetype].


### Roles on Ansible Galaxy

The Ansible roles are published on Ansibe Galaxy:

* [wcm.io DevOps Ansible roles on Ansible Galaxy][ansible-galaxy-roles]
* [wcm.io DevOps Ansible roles on GitHub][github-ansible-roles]
